# API Project: File Metadata Microservice for freeCodeCamp

## User stories

1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.

2. The form file input field  has the "name" attribute set to
"upfile". We rely on this in testing.

3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

## Usage

* `yarn install` for installing dependency and `yarn start` for starting the server
  
* Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.
